## 🔧 Toggle Between Test Level and Real Level

```gdscript
const SHOW_MENU_ON_START: bool = false
const USE_TEST_LEVEL: bool = false  # false = Level 1, true = test level
```

**Options:**
- `SHOW_MENU_ON_START = true` → Menu
- `USE_TEST_LEVEL = true` → Test level (basic platforms)
- Both false → **Level 1 with trajineras** ← Current setting

---

## 🎵 Music

The game will play **World 1 music** which has that beautiful Oaxacan/traditional Mexican vibe. The audio system is already wired to play the correct track for each world.

If you don't hear music:
- Check GameState.music_enabled = true
- Verify .ogg files exist in assets/audio/music/
- Volume might be low in AudioManager
