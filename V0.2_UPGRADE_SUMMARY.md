# Xochi v0.2 Asset Upgrade Summary

## Status: ✅ UPGRADED

Successfully swapped sprites with bird enemies and new character assets.

## Changes Made

### 1. Character Sprites
- **Updated**: `sprites/Mario.json` → now points to `xochi_characters_v2.png`
- **New spritesheet**: `img/xochi_characters_v2.png` 
- **Changes**: Updated sprite coordinates to match new sheet layout

### 2. Enemy Sprites  
- **Updated**: `sprites/Goomba.json` → now uses bird sprites from `birds_enemies.png`
  - Goombas are now represented as gulls/birds
  - Updated coordinates for new sprite layout
  
- **Updated**: `sprites/Koopa.json` → now uses bird sprites from `birds_enemies.png`
  - Koopas are now represented as herons/birds
  - Updated coordinates with proper xsize/ysize for 17x32 frames

### 3. New Assets Added
All PNG files copied from `neworld/` to `img/`:
- `img/xochi_characters_v2.png` - Updated character sprites
- `img/birds_enemies.png` - Bird enemies (gull and heron)
- `img/xochi_tiles.png` - Tiles (not yet integrated - incompatible format)
- `img/xochi_fx.png` - Effects (not yet integrated - incompatible format)
- `img/xochi_items.png` - Items (not yet integrated - incompatible format)
- `img/xochi_parallax.png` - Background parallax (not yet integrated)

### 4. Files Restored
The following files were incompatible with the current game engine and were restored to original:
- `sprites/BackgroundSprites.json` - Missing required fields (scalefactor, collision)
- `sprites/Animations.json` - Incompatible with current structure
- `sprites/ItemAnimations.json` - Mixed animation/static sprite definitions

## What Works Now

✅ **Character sprites** - Xochi loaded from new spritesheet  
✅ **Goomba enemies** - Now bird enemies  
✅ **Koopa enemies** - Now heron enemies  
✅ **Game launches** - No errors  
✅ **Enemy animations** - Work with bird sprites

## Known Incompatibilities

The new tile/background/effects assets from the v0.2 pack are not compatible with the current game engine because they use a different JSON structure that expects:
- Different required fields
- Different animation format
- Missing scalefactor/collision fields for background sprites

## Next Steps

To fully integrate the remaining v0.2 assets, you would need to:
1. Update the game engine's sprite loader to handle the new format
2. Or manually convert the JSON structures to match the expected format
3. Update level data to use new tile names

## Testing

Game runs successfully with updated character and enemy sprites. All core gameplay should work as expected.
